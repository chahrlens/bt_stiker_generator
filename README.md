## Usage
In order to enjoy it,  make sure you have python 3.7+ installed,  you must also have python3-pip installed in order to install the script requirements. So far it has only been tested on Linux host, for Windows  user has not been tested yet only with Linux on WSL2. For the first time run the


```bash
python3 set_atados.py file
```


The first time it runs, I don't know what it does, but it has created a file with the name "config.con", this file saves parameters that will be used to connect to the database server
